	Greetings!!!

This is the Sulat Baybayin X, under the X-Series of MPOP Reverse II. This is the Help Desk Section where it may guide you how to use the entire application.

This are the following commands that you may use:
1. ᜶ᜄᜊᜌ᜔

	- This command is what I called, Baybay Silay, a command where you may see the baybayin scripts with the corresponding characters. It also added with the baybayin rule (English and Tagalog). It also added, what are the invalid character in unicode names and also the version of baybayin used.
